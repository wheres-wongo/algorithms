# Assignment 05: Stacks / Queues  

For this assignment you will be building a program to evaluate fully parenthesized arithmetic expressions using Djikstra's Two Stack Algorithm for expression evaluation.

## The Algorithm

Djikstra's two stack algorithm is a way to evaluate fully parenthesized infix expressions.

- Infixed expressions are those where the operators are placed between two operands, (2 + 4) is an infix expression.
- Full parenthesized means that every operator and it's operands are contained in parentheses, which means precedence and associativity do not matter.

An example expression:

$$((5 + ((10 - 4) * (3 + 2))) + 25)$$

For each element in the expression, the following rules are applied:

| Element           | Action                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Operand           | Push to stack 1                                                                                                                                   |
| Operator          | Push to stack 2                                                                                                                                   |
| Left Parenthesis  | Ignore                                                                                                                                            |
| Right Parenthesis | Pop an operator from stack 2 and two values from stack 1, then apply the operator to those two values, the result gets pushed back onto stack one |

Using only these simple rules, and two functioning stacks, you can solve any infix fully parenthesized expression!
